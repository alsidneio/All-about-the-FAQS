        JQuery is a Javascript framework, which purpose is to make it much easier
        to use Javascript on your website. You could also describe JQuery as an abstraction
        layer, since it takes functionality that you would have to write many
        lines of javascipt to accomplish and wraps into funtions that you can
        call with a single line of code.

        no, you dont need to know Javascript to use JQuery. in act, JQuery tries
        to simplify a lot of the complicated things with Javascript., like AJAX
         calls and DOM manipulation, so that you may do these things without knowing
         Javascript.
